# RC-Car

The Joystick-Testing repository includes all my work in studying how the Arduino joystick functions and how it can be used to control an RC car.

The CAD-Files repository includes all my CAD models for designing the RC car. The frame was fabricated through [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) and the motors and wheels were obtained through [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/).
