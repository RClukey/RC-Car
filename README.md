# RC-Car

The Arduino-C++ repository includes all my work in studying how the Arduino joystick functions and how it can be used to control an RC car, as well as the final, production code to control the car.

The CAD-Files repository includes all my CAD models for designing the RC car. The frame was fabricated by [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) and the motors and wheels were obtained through [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/).
